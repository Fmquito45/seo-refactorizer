# Seo-Refactor

## Description

This project consisted in refactoring an existing web application. Although it was a completed code, we could still refactor code and improve it without changing its operations. I had to be careful in making this site more accessible and meet new certain set of standards without changing its original response and I believe that's what motivated me, to leave the code a little cleaner than when we found it. This project was created to help others in thier bussiness find a social solution with Search Engine Optimization and online Reputation Managment and Social Media marketing. I made it easier to navigate through the header navigations links to send the user to appropriate location of the page. I set all site headings attributes to be ordered correctly for a clear reading from top to bottom. In refactoring this code I was able to learn how to link the navigation links to the appropriate ID attributes for proper page scrolling of the section. I learned how to properly use semantical elements in html to follow an organized and local structure. As well in css I was able to use appropriate CSS selectors to follow semantic elements.

## Usage

You can navigate through the top links to be directed to the section of social service offered.
